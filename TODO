TODO:
- Allow usage of OEM callbacks without having to pass -eventmodel => "both"
- carp if onMouseIn/Out specified and no GetCapture?
- Update the demo script to show behaviour if Win32::API and Win32::GUI::BitmapInline are not available.

- Replace the tabs with spaces (tab = 4 spaces), so that the layout is not
  messed up by people with different tabstop settings

- Test suit should be extended to test the GUI itself.  Perhaps with Win32::GUITest?
- Am I installing the demo script in a suitable location?

- prepare for later (and earlier?) releases of Win32::GUI by testing for the functions we want: UNIVERSAL->can()
- Make this work with versions of Win32::GUI that don't support NEM?

- Raise bug reports for the Win32::GUI bugs discovered while
  preparing this.
