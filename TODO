TODO:
- Allow usage of OEM callbacks without having to pass
    -eventmodel => "both"
- carp if onMouseIn/Out specified and no GetCapture?
- Test suit should be extended to test the GUI itself.  Perhaps with
  Win32::GUITest?
- prepare for later (and earlier?) releases of Win32::GUI by testing
  for the functions we want: UNIVERSAL->can()
- Make this work with versions of Win32::GUI that don't support NEM?

- Can we get CVS to update the VERSION in README file?
- Add postamble to Makefile.PL to automate make of PPM distribution
