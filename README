Win32-GUI-HyperLink
-------------------

VERSION

This is Win32::GUI::HyperLink v0.12

INTRODUCTION

Win32::GUI::HyperLink is a Win32::GUI class that implements a Label
object that acts as a clickable hyperlink:

By default it has a 'hand' Cursor, is drawn in blue text rather than
black and the text is underlined when the mouse is over the text.
The Label can be clicked to launch a hyperlink.

REQUIRES

Win32::GUI v1.0 or higher
Win32::API for full functionality - currently you lose the ability to
  have the text of the label dynamically underlined when the mouse is
  over the link if you don't have this module.
Win32::GUI::BitmapInline (as distributed with Win32::GUI).  This
  module is only needed if you don't have Win32::API.  If neither
  this module nor Win32:API are available, then the cursor will not
  change to a hand when the mouse is over the link

DOCUMENTATION

There is full POD documentation inside the HyperLink.pm file.
There is a demonstration script provided, showing most of the
features.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Alternatively, as a manual installation, extract the HyperLink.pm file
from the dirtribution, and put it at C:\Perl\site\lib\Win32\GUI
(adjust as necessary for your Perl installation directory)

A PPM distribution is available at http://www.robmay.me.uk/win32gui/
